# Cryptopals soltuions in Rust

Introduction
------------

[Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) is a set of challenges to learn (and break) crypto. 

Once I've learned of these challenges, I've decided to kill two birds in one stone and learn Rust.

This is my shared attempt of writing clean Rust code and provide an (hopefully) easy to read, efficient solutions to Cryptopals great challenges.

## Where are all the solutions?

For now, the following sets are solved:

 - Set 1
 - Set 2
