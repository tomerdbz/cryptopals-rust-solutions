from=BBBBBBBBBBB

easy mode - let's assume that if the frontend will accept a big amount (with padding)
E(MAC XOR ";attacker:6666\x2\x2") == NEW_MAC

but I can make E("from=1\xb\xb\xb\xb\xb\xb\xb\xb\xb\xb\xb")
so I can inject E(MAC XOR (MAC XOR ))

so if victim sends:
"from=victim&tx_list=friend:100\x2\x2" || MAC

I'm want it to be:
"from=victim&tx_list=friend:100\x2\x2;attacker:6666\x2\x2" || NEW_MAC

send your message - sniff the mac
now - add your evil extension (to your msg) and you got the new MAC
so you know E(prev_mac XOR extension) == new_mac
but, you want to get E(MAC XOR extension)
how can we generate MAC?
let's assume we can extend with MAC - so we now got(prev_mac XOR MAC)

another property is that if the text fits in the block - then another final block of \x0f is added
now, a trivial way to win in easy mode - is just choose in your own message:
extension = prev_mac XOR MAC XOR real_malicious_extension
then you got your E(MAC XOR real_malicious_extension)
and you could just append your real_malicious_extension to the victim message

this is all well under the assumption the frontend will accept an ugly message and transmit it
